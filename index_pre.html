    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>seL4</h3>
    <p>I worked as a research engineer (or research assistant), under the
    supervision of <a href=
    "http://www.ssrg.nicta.com.au/people/?cn=Gerwin+Klein">Dr. Gerwin
    Klein</a>, on the <a
    href="http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/seL4/">L4.verified project</a>,
    which ran from 2005 until 2009, and produced the world's first formally
    verified general-purpose operating-system <a href=
    "#Klein_EHACDEEKNSTW_09">kernel</a>.</p>

    <p>I was responsible for the high-performance C and assembly
    implementation of the verified ARM kernel, which achieved the highest
    published IPC performance of any microkernel on this architecture.</p>

    <p>I was also heavily involved in producing our underlying reasoning
    framework, in particular our <a href= "#Cock_KS_08">monadic Hoare
    calculus</a>.</p>

    <h3>Verified Bitfield Generation</h3>
    <p>We were able to automatically generate a substantial fraction of the
    code in seL4, and its associated proof of correctness, namely the
    low-level manipulation of packed structures (or bitfields).  A description
    of this work has been <a href="#Cock_08">published</a>, and the tool
    itself is <a href=
    "http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/software/TS/bitfield_gen/">publically
    available</a></p>

    <h3>pGCL in Isabelle</h3>
    <p>To support my PhD work, I developed a formalisation of the
    probabilistic programming logic/refinement calculus pGCL, of McIver and
    Morgan.  This package is available under an open source license.  For
    details see <a href="pGCL/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Covert Channel Analysis Suite</h3>
    <p>Also as part of my PhD work, I conducted a systematic large-scale
    empirical study of side-channel bandwidth on seL4.  The toolkit that I
    built up in the course of this work, in order to efficiently process and
    analyse large sparse channel matrices, has also now been <a href=
    "http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/software/TS/channel_tools/">released</a>.</p>
