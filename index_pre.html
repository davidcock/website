    <p>It has become apparent that producing systems software to the highest
    degree of assurance is possible, without sacrificing performance, and at
    lower cost than has historically been assumed.  With careful design and
    effective use of automation, it should be possible to reduce the cost to
    the point that such an approach is commonplace for critical systems, and
    tackle currently unsolved issues, including concurrency.  A strong
    familiarity with the discipline of low-level systems programming, and an
    understanding of the application domain will remain essential to ensure
    that performance is not sacrificed.  Likewise, a clear understanding of
    the state of the art in formal verification is essential to ensure that
    systems are designed such that verification remains tractable.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div>
    <h3>seL4</h3>
    <div style="min-height:5em">
    <a href="http://sel4.systems">
    <img src="imgs/sel4-logo.svg"
         style="float:right; height:5em; margin: 1em"/>
    </a>
    <p>I worked as a research engineer (or research assistant), under the
    supervision of <a href=
    "http://www.ssrg.nicta.com.au/people/?cn=Gerwin+Klein">Gerwin
    Klein</a>, on the <a
    href="http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/seL4/">L4.verified project</a>,
    which ran from 2005 until 2009, and produced the world's first formally
    verified general-purpose operating-system <a href=
    "#Klein_EHACDEEKNSTW_09">kernel</a>, which is now available as 
    <a href="http://sel4.systems">open source!</a></p>

    <p>I was responsible for the high-performance C and assembly
    implementation of the verified ARM kernel, which achieved the highest
    published IPC performance of any microkernel on this architecture.</p>

    <p>I was also heavily involved in producing our underlying reasoning
    framework, in particular our <a href= "#Cock_KS_08">monadic Hoare
    calculus</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Verified Bitfield Generation</h3>
    <p>We were able to automatically generate a substantial fraction of the
    code in seL4, and its associated proof of correctness, namely the
    low-level manipulation of packed structures (or bitfields).  A description
    of this work has been <a href="#Cock_08">published</a>, and the tool
    itself is <a href=
    "http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/software/TS/bitfield_gen/">publically
    available</a></p>

    <h3>Timing Channels in seL4</h3>
    <div style="min-height:15em">
    <img src="imgs/tls_times.svg"
         style="float:right; height:15em; margin: 1em"/>
    <p>Since the <a
    href="https://stage.ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/infoflow.pml">
    noninterference proof</a> for seL4 showed that <em>storage channels</em>
    could be provable eliminated in a kernel such as seL4, my Ph.D. work was
    on tackling <em>timing channels</em>, which are invisible to the type of
    formal specification used for seL4.  For more detail on this project, see
    <a href="https://stage.ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/sidechannels.pml">
    here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The figure on the right shows the effectiveness of one of our
    mitigation strategies, <em>scheduled delivery</em>, used here to mitigate
    the <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/OpenSSL+Security+Advisory+including+Lucky+Thirteen%3A+Breaking+the+TLS+and+DTLS+Record+Protocols/15085">
    Lucky 13 attack</a> against <a
    href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>.  This can be implemented
    without kernel modification, and achieves higher performance and better
    security than a constant-time implementation.  For more information, see
    our <a href="#Cock_GMH_14">CCS paper</a>.

    <h3>pGCL in Isabelle</h3>
    <p>To support my PhD work, I developed a formalisation of the
    probabilistic programming logic/refinement calculus pGCL, of McIver and
    Morgan.  This package is available under an open source license, and is
    now in the <a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/pGCL.shtml">archive
    of formal proofs</a>.  For recent versions, see <a
    href="pGCL/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Covert Channel Analysis Suite</h3>
    <div style="min-height:15em">
    <img src="imgs/exynos4_pmu.svg"
         style="float:right; height:15em; margin: 1em"/>
    <p>Also as part of my PhD work, I conducted a systematic large-scale
    empirical study of side-channel bandwidth on seL4.  The toolkit that I
    built up in the course of this work, in order to efficiently process and
    analyse large sparse channel matrices, has also now been <a href=
    "http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/software/TS/channel_tools/">released</a>.</p>
    <p>The figure on the right shows the residual channel on and Exynos4412,
    after using instruction-based scheduling to mitigate the cache-contention
    channel.  For more details, see the <a href="#Cock_GMH_14">paper</a>, or
    my Ph.D. thesis, available below.</p>
